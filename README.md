## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Glad you're here, and I'm happy to tell you a little bit about myself!

I am passionate about exploring how AI can enhance scientific workflows. In essence, AI is revolutionizing scientific research by making it quicker and more cost-effective from initial experiments to publication, while also spurring innovation and raising important ethical questions. This is where much of my recent effort is focused.

- ðŸ‘¥ I lead a junior AI research group funded by the [BMBF](https://www.bmbf.de/bmbf/de/home/home_node.html), called [SCINEXT](https://scinext-project.github.io/)â€”short for Neural-Symbolic Scholarly Innovation Extraction. This highlights our group's focus on the intersection of AI and scholarly communication.
- ðŸ”­ My current projects involve the research and development of NLP and machine learning models, aimed at high-precision scientific knowledge extraction, ontology knowledge engineering, and subject indexing within modern digital library systems. Additionally, we explore the use of LLMs as evaluators in these contexts.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning about autonomous experimentation workflows to enhance our research efficiency.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m eager to collaborate on research projects that implement AI in scientific discovery.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m seeking expertise in semantic modeling, particularly related to material sciences, focusing on atomic layer deposition and etching processes.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I recently participated in my first marathonâ€”the 50th Berlin Marathon!
