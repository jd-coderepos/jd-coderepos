## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ‘¥ I lead a junior AI research group funded by the BMBF, called SCINEXTâ€”short for Neural-Symbolic Scholarly Innovation Extraction. This highlights our group's focus on the intersection of AI and scholarly communication.
- ðŸ”­ My current projects involve the research and development of NLP and machine learning models, aimed at high-precision scientific knowledge extraction, ontology knowledge engineering, and subject indexing within modern digital library systems. Additionally, we explore the use of LLMs as evaluators in these contexts.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning about autonomous experimentation workflows to enhance our research efficiency.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m keen to collaborate on research projects that implement AI in scientific discovery.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m seeking expertise in semantic modeling, particularly related to material sciences, focusing on atomic layer deposition and etching processes.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I recently participated in my first marathonâ€”the 50th Berlin Marathon!
